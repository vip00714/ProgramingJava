Methods which does not have a body and the class containing them totally depends on the sub-classes to provide the body,
are called abstract methods and class containing one or more than one abstract method is called an abstract class.

sub-classes which contains the body must override the methods in the super class.

We cannot create objects of an abstract class. Thus, constructors of an abstract class is not allowed.

Abstract static method cannot be made as static methods cannot be overridden and abstract methods should be overriden.

But we can create static methods in abstract class.

Abstract class can have normal method.
As multiple inheritance is not supported in java thus a class cannot extends more than one class.
