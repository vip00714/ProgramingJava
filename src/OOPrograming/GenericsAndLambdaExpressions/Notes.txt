Generics were introduced to provide a tighter type checks at compile time and to support generic programing.
Generics are implemented at compile time.

1. generic types<T> with Primitive types cannot be instantiate.
2. instance of type parameters cannot be created.
3. Type parameters fields cannot be declared static. because static fields are at class level, and they are used by all the
   non-static members of the class.
